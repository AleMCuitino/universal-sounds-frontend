## How to install this project
  **BACK** 
* Clone git https://github.com/anaruedaguiu/apiHackathon.git
* Create a local database on phpMyAdmin:
  - Database name: ***universalsounds***
* Create an .env file by copying the contents of .env.example and modify the database name (laravel by universalsounds)
* Install dependencies in a Visual Studio Code terminal:
  - Run ***npm install*** or ***npm update*** command
  - Run ***composer install***
* Activate the server and keep this terminal open:
  - Run ***npm run dev*** command
* Run the server in a Visual Studio Code new terminal using (and keep this terminal open):
  - ***php artisan serve*** command
* Run migration:
  - ***php artisan migration:fresh --seed*** command

  **FRONT**
* Clone git https://github.com/AleMCuitino/universal-sounds-frontend.git 

* Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

* Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

* `npm start`



### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

* `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

* `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

```bash
  php artisan test
